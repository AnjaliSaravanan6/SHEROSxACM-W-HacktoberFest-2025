## üéØ What Is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is an annual global event sponsored by DigitalOcean that encourages people to contribute to open-source software during the month of October. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

- To participate, contributors submit **pull requests** (PRs) to **public repositories** marked as participating.  
- For a PR to count, it must be merged or approved by a maintainer. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Repositories opt in by adding the `hacktoberfest` topic, and maintainers label issues/PRs they want help with. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

It‚Äôs a way to celebrate open source, build your skills, and help meaningful projects.
