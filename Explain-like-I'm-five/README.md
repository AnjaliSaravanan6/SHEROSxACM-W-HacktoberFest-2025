# 🧠 Explain Like I'm Five

Welcome to **Explain Like I’m Five** (ELI5)— a collaborative project where we take complex topics in data science, AI, and computing, and explain them as if we were talking to a curious five-year-old (or just a tired grad student).  

Our goal is to make hard ideas beautifully simple — through short explanations, tiny code demos, and playful analogies.

## 🌟 What You’ll Find Here

This repository is organized into broad themes, each containing bite-sized “ELI5” explanations:

| Theme | What it explores |
|--------|------------------|
| 📊 Data Science | How we use data to find patterns, make predictions, and tell stories with numbers |
| ⚙️ Algorithms | How computers solve problems step-by-step — from sorting to search to decision-making |
| 🛡️ Cybersecurity | How we protect information, prevent attacks, and build safe digital systems |


Each subfolder includes:
- A short **explanation** (`.md`)
- A **tiny demo or visualization** (`.ipynb` or `.py`)
- Optional **illustrations** or analogies
