## 1️⃣ Cybersecurity

Protecting data, systems, and people in the digital world — because even the smartest code needs a lock.

#### Topics:

- **Encryption and Decryption** – Turning messages into secret codes and back again.  
  *Like whispering through a language only your friend can understand.*

- **Hashing and Integrity** – Ensuring information hasn’t been tampered with.  
  *A digital fingerprint — if it changes, something’s wrong.*

- **Authentication and Authorization** – Proving who you are and what you’re allowed to do.  
  *The difference between showing your ID and getting the keys.*

- **Phishing and Social Engineering** – When hackers trick humans instead of machines.  
  *The weakest link is often not the firewall, but curiosity.*

- **Network Security & Firewalls** – Building digital borders that filter good from bad.  
  *Like airport security for data packets — scanning every traveler before entry.*
