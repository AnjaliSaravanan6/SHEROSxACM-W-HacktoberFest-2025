### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Science

From curiosity to computation ‚Äî how we turn raw information into intelligent insight.

- **Bias and Variance Trade-off** ‚Äì The eternal tug-of-war between simplicity and accuracy.  
  *Like choosing between a simple guess that works most of the time, and a complicated one that works only on your homework data.*

- **Feature Selection** ‚Äì Finding which variables actually matter.  
  *Too many ingredients, and your recipe loses its flavor.*

- **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)** ‚Äì Compressing high-dimensional chaos into something understandable.  
  *It‚Äôs like summarizing a long novel into a haiku without losing the plot.*

- **Regularization (L1 & L2)** ‚Äì Keeping models humble so they don‚Äôt overfit.  
  *The mathematical version of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt show off.‚Äù*

- **Ensemble Methods** ‚Äì Combining multiple weak learners into one strong decision-maker.  
  *Many average minds voting together can outperform a genius acting alone.*
