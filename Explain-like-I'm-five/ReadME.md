# 🧠 Explain Like I'm Five

Welcome to **Explain Like I’m Five** — a collaborative project where we take complex topics in data science, AI, and computing, and explain them as if we were talking to a curious five-year-old (or just a tired grad student).  

Our goal is to make hard ideas beautifully simple — through short explanations, tiny code demos, and playful analogies.
