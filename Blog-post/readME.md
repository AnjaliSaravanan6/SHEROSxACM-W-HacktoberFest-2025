# Blog Post

Welcome to the **Non-Code Contributions Track** for our Hacktoberfest community event hosted by the *Khoury SHEROS and ACM W*! 🌸  

While most Hacktoberfest contributions are code-based, this track celebrates the **stories, creativity, and lived experiences** that shape who we are in tech.
