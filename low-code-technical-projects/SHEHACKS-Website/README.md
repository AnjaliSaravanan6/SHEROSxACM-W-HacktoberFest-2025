## 🌟 What This Repo Is About

We’re building and improving the SHEHACKS website together — one small pull request at a time.  
You can help by:
- Enhancing the website design or accessibility
- Adding educational or career resources
- Sharing opportunities (scholarships, fellowships, hackathons)
- Fixing small UI or content issues

💡 **No contribution is too small.**  
Even fixing a typo, adding alt text, or improving readability helps someone new discover something valuable.
