# ðŸŒ± Low-Code Technical Projects

Welcome to **Low-Code Technical Projects** â€” a community space for simple, creative ideas where every contribution counts.

Each folder in this repository is a standalone mini project:  
a small notebook, dataset, or demo that explains a technical concept in a clear and approachable way â€” from classification and visualization to automation and storytelling.
